No one asked for it, but I made it anyways because I am passionate about sharing knowledge however I can. This repository contains information regarding my terminal setup, including the tools I use, the configurations of those tools, my terminal profiles, and more. Included are instructions on how to set up and use my configurations, or at least how to get started with them.

I've attempted to make this repository as automated as possible so it always stays current. To do this, I created workflows that automate updating the files in the `includes` directory when updating my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/dotfiles), which contains my shell and terminal configurations.
