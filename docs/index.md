# Customized Unix Terminal

!!! Note
    Note that this is currently a rough draft version

This repository contains all the configurations that I personally use for the style and behavior of the terminal on my Mac and Linux machines. In addition, I've listed all of the programs that I find useful or good to have at a second's notice that can be installed via the OS's package manager.

## Customizing ZSH Shell

### Framework

The framework that I use and find is the best is [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). It's one of the most popular zsh frameworks available and made it's first commit on August 23, 2009.

### Shell Theme

The theme that I use in combination with oh-my-zsh is [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). It's highly configurable, and it's a theme that I very much recommend.

#### Oh-my-zsh Plugins

### Modifying LSCOLOR

In `~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh`, comment out the line that begins with `export LSCOLORS=`, then place `export LSCOLORS="exgxfxDxcxegDhabagacaD"` on the line below it.

Below is a key to help you understand what the values of the LSCOLORS variable mean:

| Letter Code | Type | Text Color | Foreground/Background Color|
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| ex | Directories | blue | *default* |
| gx | Symbolic link | cyan | *default* |
| fx | Socket | magenta | *default* |
| Dx | Pipe | yellow | *default* |
| cx | Executable | green | *default* |
| eg | Block special | green | cyan
| Dh | Character special | yellow | grey |
| ab | Executable with setuid bit set | black | red |
| ag | Executable with setgid bit set | black | cyan |
| ac | Directory writeable to others (with a sticky bit) | black | green |
| aD | Directory writeable to others (without sticky bit) | black | yellow |

After setting up the new LSCOLORS, you will need to modify the terminal profile ANSI-colors to your liking or import my personal terminal profile (instructions below).

## Terminal Profile

=== "macOS"
    My custom terminal profile is a modified version of the Basic Terminal profile in Catalina. To add it to your list of profiles and make it your default, follow the instructions below:

    1. Open the Terminal application.
    2. Click on Preferences... > Profiles > *the gear at the bottom left of the window* > Import... > *locate and click on 'Basic (Modified).terminal'*
    3. Click on the new terminal profile, then press the "Default" button at the window's bottom.

=== "Linux"
    N/A

## Vim Resource File

### With Vundle

These configurations modify the behavior and look of vim. To use all of the configurations listed below, you will need to first [install Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). Once Vundle is installed, place the code below into your `.vimrc` located at your home directory. Then to install the plugins, open `.vimrc` with vim, then enter `:source %` and `:PluginInstall` (separately). When using `:source %`, you can ignore any errors that might occur, as these will be cause by the fact that the plugins aren't installed yet.

```vim

### Without Vundle

These configurations modify some of the default vim settings to provide a better vim experience (at least that what I think). To set them, create `.vimrc` in your home directory and add the code below to it.

```vim
" Set's the default vim settings
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim

" Overwrites specified default setting
set tabstop=4     " Tells vim how many columns a tab counts for
set shiftwidth=4  " 'Levels of indentation', where a level of indentation is
                  " shiftwidth columns of whitespace
set expandtab     " Ensure that when you hit tab it will actually use spaces
set mouse-=a      " Exchanges the ability to move the cursor with your mouse,
                  " with the ability to highlight and copy text
```
